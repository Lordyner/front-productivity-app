# front-productivity-app

This is a side-project that's born from a desire to learn react and also to have an app to help me track progress on my goals.


# Opportunities 

The app allows you to create "opportunities", which are daily goals you want to accomplish.
You can create, update, read and delete these opportunities.

# Future features

Another important feature that I will work on is stats. Showing stats to the user about how much opportunities he accomplish per day e.t.c.
Other features I want to develop are : monthly goals (with stats), users settings, connection with Google account, having a sort of networking media to help you accomplish your goals.
